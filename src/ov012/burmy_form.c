// Burmy's form after a battle, from the terrain it was fought on. The name is descriptive: the ROM has no string for
// this file, which the order of overlay 12's .rodata separates from event_battle.c (its 140-byte table comes before
// that file's smaller ones, which one file's size-sorted data can't do). Function name from swan
